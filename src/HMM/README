To run the program, Run the HMMDriver.java class. You will them be prompted with a couple questions, including how many walls you'd
like to have in your 4x4 map, and the move sequence you'd like the robot to attempt (4 moves total).

Then, the console will display the belief state after each move, the map including the robots position, wall positions, and
location colors, and which the direction the robot attempted to move on that turn.

 Enjoy!!
